<h1>Thiruvananthapuram</h1>
<div class="col-7">Thiruvananthapuram is a relatively modern region with trading traditions dating back to 1000 BCE.[27][28] It is believed that the ships of King Solomon landed in a port called Ophir (now Poovar) in Thiruvananthapuram in 1036 BCE.[29][30] The city was the trading post of spices, sandalwood and ivory.[31] However, the ancient political and cultural history of the city was almost entirely independent from that of the rest of Kerala.

    The Chera dynasty governed the area of Malabar Coast between Alappuzha in the south to Kasaragod in the north. This included Palakkad Gap, Coimbatore, Salem, and Kolli Hills. The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during Sangam period between c. first and the fourth centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the Malabar Coast and Tamil Nadu.[32] However the southern region of present-day Kerala state (The coastal belt between Thiruvananthapuram and Alappuzha) was under Ay dynasty, who was more related to the Pandya dynasty of Madurai.[33]
    
    The early rulers of the city were the Ays. Vizhinjam, which is now a region in the present-day Thiruvananthapuram, was the capital of the Ay dynasty.[34] Vizhinjam was an important port city from as early as the second century BC.[35][36] During the Ay dynasty's rule, Thiruvananthapuram witnessed many battles in which the Chola and Pandyan dynasties attempted to capture the port town.[37][38]f</div>
